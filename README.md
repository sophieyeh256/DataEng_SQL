# DataEng_SQL
UCB MIDS W205 Data Engineering Course Projects

A few years ago, a new startup was born: **Acme Gourmet Meals (AGM)**.

The founder of AGM was a sous chef in a 5-star restaurant, named Joy, who had worked her way up from dishwasher to cook to sous chef.  As part of her job, Joy frequently shopped at the high end grocercy stores that featured organic and healtier selections for their food, at premium prices, as the 5-star restaurant wanted only the highest quality ingrediants for their food.  Also, part of her job was to be paid to eat meals on her time off at other restaurants from fast food to other 5-star to see what types of food and quality were being served.  

## Project 1 Skills
* Expand your GitHub knowledge (working on a branch, creating a pull request, etc.)
* Design queries using a Data Model in ERD format (versus hack style SQL based on just looking at tables and guessing)
* Using a secondary dataset to enhance a primary dataset
* Open ended business questions from executives: analyzing, giving an answer, and supporting that answer with data
* Designing an appropriate data visualization to present supporting data
* Functional programming using Python and SQL
* Working in the Linux command line
* Working in the cloud (AWS)
* Working in a VM in the cloud instead of physical computer
* Working in a cluster of Docker containers running inside a VM in the cloud

## Project 2 Skills
In this project, you will gain new skills:
* Design and create a mapping table to assist with integrating 3rd party IDs with primary database IDs
* Recursive walk through a nested JSON file to help understand the structure
* Parse a nested JSON files to produce CSV files with proper parent / child table linkeage
* Design and create staging tables that can accept dirty data from CSV files
* Load dirty data into staging tables from CSV files
* Validate data in staging tables 
* Validate data in staging tables matching against primary database tables 
* Validate data in staging tables matching against secondary database tables 
* Data exploration in staging tables
* Cleansing data in staging tables 
* Preliminary analytics from staging tables



## Project 3 Skills
