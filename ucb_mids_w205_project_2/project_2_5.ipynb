    "I recommend that we withhold customer data from 3rd party sales channels. Table 2.5.3 concluded that only 13.4% of Peak's customer records do not match to AGM's customers table. Of the 97 customers, it is only 13. Additionally, further investigation revealed that most mismatches can be easily resolved with common matching techniques. \n",

    "For all 13 rows that did not have any exact matches to AGM's customers table, soundex, levenshtein distance, metaphone and dmetaphone matching functions were tested. The levenshtein distance function was selected as the best joining technique because the query revealed that first and last names were mismatched due to spelling mistakes and the first syllable doesn’t always match. The streets names also differed in word spacing, capitalization, abbreviation, and typos. \n",
    " \n",
    "Matching all rows using the levenshtein distance required tuning the sensitivity for each column-pair. This can be impractical if the data contains a large number rows without exact matches. Since the sensitivity is set for an entire column-pair, it might not work on a dataset with a wide range of levenshtein distances from a single typo in a short name to multiple typos in a long name. However for this purpose where the dataset is small enough to be checked by eye, it is easy to manually tune the sensitivity settings. Furthermore, the problem of large datasets can be mitigated with using machine learning and deep learning to measure string distances. While it may take more functions to achieve accurate matches in large, diverse datasets, it would be feasible to do so.\n"
